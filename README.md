# spork
Right now it just tokenizes the file (./examples/01.spork) and prints out in csv formate. Later ill get more stuff but rn thats all. This is my new project, a simple c-like programming language. Here is some code examples:
## Code examples:
- Hello world!
```
@include "std" : std;

fun main[](string[] args) {
  std.println("Hello world!\n");
}
```
